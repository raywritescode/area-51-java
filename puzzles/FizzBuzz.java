// FizzBuzz.java
// The classic FizzBuzz coding test.

// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print
// "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers
// which are mulitples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

/* pseudocode
   
   Repeat starting at 1 to 100
      If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"
      Otherwise, if the number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
      Otherwise, if the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
      increment the count by 1
